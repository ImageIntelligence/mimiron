- `set-var` should validation tfvars config file before committing and pushing`
- maybe rename `set-sha` to `link` and `set-var` to something else...
- add `--latest` `set-sha` to automatically use the latest commit sha
- io.err shouldn't exit(1). functions should handle the error properly
- add `mim cd <environment>|<deployment>` so easily change directories`
- all commits by mimiron should have "Committed by Mimiron <ImageIntelligence/mimiron.git>" in the message body
- when selecting a sha, the table should indicate the current selected sha
- set-var should show a diff and prompt user to continue (can be overriden with --no-diff)
